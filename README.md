#Bridgerton Quiz Game

##Game Description
Welcome to the Bridgerton Quiz Game! This interactive game tests your knowledge of the popular book and TV series Bridgerton. Answer questions correctly to move on to the next round and prove you are the ultimate Bridgerton fan. If you get a question wrong, you lose and will need to start over.

I chose Bridgerton for this game because it's a beloved show with a dedicated fanbase, making it a fun and engaging theme for a trivia game.
